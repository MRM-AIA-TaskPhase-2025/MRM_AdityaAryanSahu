in task 4 we make a new branch "temp" and push a file "Task_3.md" using terminal
steps include:
1)"cd MRM_AdityaAryanSahu" to change to this directory.
2) then "git branch Temp" to make the new branch, and "git checkout Temp" to switch to that branch.
3)Using "touch" and "nano" we make a file 'Task_3.md'.
4)"git add file_name" is used to add the file to the local repository and "git commit -m <message>" to commit to the changes.
5)finally "git push origin Temp" is used to push the file to that branch.

For task 5 we merged branch temp with the main barnch and a text file "Temp_4_5.md" was craeted.
Steps include:
1)"git checkout main" to switcth to the main branch and "git merge Temp" to merge the two branches.
2) 'touch file_name" was used to make the new file and "nano" used to edit it.
3)"git add file_name" and "git commit -m <messgae>" was used to commit to the changes.
4) "git push origin main" was used to push the file to the main branch.
