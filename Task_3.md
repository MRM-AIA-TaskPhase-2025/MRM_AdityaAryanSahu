in Task 3, we first downloaded a file "Employee.csv" and then pushed it to the folder "github_task"
the steps include:
1)the the file was moved using "mv file_name destination_location" to the Github_task by first using "cd ~/Downloads" where the file was downloaded 
2) then "cd ~/Desktop","cd MRM_AdityaAryanSahu" to change directory and "cd github_task" to access the folder.
3) then "git add ." and "git commit -m <message>" was used to commit to the changes.
4)"git push origin main" was used to push the file to the main repository to "Github_task" folder.
