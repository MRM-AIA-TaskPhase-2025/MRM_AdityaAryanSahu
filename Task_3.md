in Task 3, we first downloaded a file "Employee.csv" and then pushed it to the folder "github_task"
the steps include:
1) first "cd MRM_AdityaAryanSahu" to change to that directory.
2)then "cd github_task" to go to that directory.
3)the the file was moved using "mv file_name destination_location" to the Github_task folder.
4) then "git add ." and "git commit -m <message>" was used to commit to the changes.
5)"git push origin main" was used to push the file to the main repository to "Github_task" folder.
