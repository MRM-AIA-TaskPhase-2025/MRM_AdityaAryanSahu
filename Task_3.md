the steps include:
1) first "cd ~/Downloads" was used then the file was moved using "mv Employee.csv ~Desktop/MRM_AdityaAryanSahu/Github_task" to folder Github_task
2) then use "cd ~/Desktop","cd MRM_AdityaAryanSahu" to change directory and "cd Github_task" to access the folder.
3) then "git add ." and "git commit -m <message>" was used to commit to the changes.
